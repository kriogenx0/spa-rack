# SPA Rack

### Purpose

A first step to building a lightweight SPA server. This is a stepping stone away from Rails.

### Getting Started

```sh
./bin/sprack install
./bin/sprack start
```

This will install node modules, build webpack, run bundle install, and start the rack server.

### Reasons to Consider Rack

- You're used to Rails with a SPA.
- You have gems in Ruby.
- You need a ruby API Proxy because you cannot use CORS.
- You want the lightest, fastest ruby server available.

### Why not server-less?

- You're almost there. But you need to integrate with services.
- You're concerned about security. Really not a good reason though, Server-less SPAs can be secure.
- You need CORS
- You need some server-side code of some kind
